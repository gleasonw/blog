I received an email from my Grandma this past week, lamenting the blog's absence, and moving me to action. Family is all we have, and our internal organs, if we're lucky. Like a garden, or a frothing sourdough starter, they both require attention. It has been a while since I have written freely, so forgive me as I run my scales: pondering vivaceous hippopotamus. Freewheeling rambling. So on and such as.

Lyon is a wonderful city. The hill of Fourviere, where I live, 200 meters from the basillica. It is glamorous, well-touristed, and surreal. I am here. The markets had cherries last month, apricots a couple weeks ago, now cucumbers and tomatoes. The bakery nearby sells crackling chocolate croissants and baguettes with a crust like thin glass, poky, sometimes. The cheese is dank, salty, sweet, or tart, and always abundant. 

Work has been tumultous. Deeply satisfying, yet the company went bankrupt a few months after I arrived. I have been laid off! The future is unclear, but I will be staying another three months, I think. Ultimately, I was lucky to come here in the first place; I am handling the tumult well. I have no idea if I will continue working in France or return to the states. I like Lyon, but I love my family, the Pacific Northwest, and the ability to communicate freely, without trying to parse the translation of "awkward" into French. My near-fluency in French has made acculturation smooth, I feel connected to the French people around me. However, it is a **near** fluency. My accent is impressive, a facade of mastery, but my comprehension and vocabulary is nowhere near native-level. The gap creates much awkwardness. Such is being foreign! Naught to do but practice.
