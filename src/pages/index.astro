        I'm Will Gleason, a humanities major turned full-stack developer building a digital humanities
        tool, <a target="_blank" class="underline text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 hover:cursor visited:text-purple-600" href="https://d32d5ops9ui5td.cloudfront.net/">the Gallica Grapher</a
        >. I'm currently migrating the project from CRA to Next.js and
        Typescript. 
        <br />
        <br />
        I like to write my APIs in Python or Go, my user interfaces in React and
        Typescript. I persist my data with Postgres. I have tried GraphQL for API
        data validation, but I think it's excessive for my current needs. I have
        just started experimenting with tRPC and Python's marvelous FastAPI. For static projects,
        such as this website, Astro.js is my favorite tool.
        <br />

        A developer I appreciate lists only an apple cider recipe on their website.
        Because I need a job, I will not do that. Here's what I've been doing since
        graduating from Carleton College in 2021.
