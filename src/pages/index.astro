    I'm a developer, 2021 Carleton College graduate, and French history major. I code in the hopes of making public data more accesible. I currently work in Lyon, France as a frontend developer. On the side, I maintain the <a

      href="https://www.gallicagrapher.com/">Gallica Grapher</a
    >, a tool that plots word occurrences in 19th-century French newspapers. I also maintain a <a target="_blank" href="https://nl-joke-val.vercel.app">Twitch dashboard</a> that tracks emotes and +2 counts for streamer Northernlion.

    I like to write my APIs in <a

      href="https://github.com/gleasonw/gallica-grapher/blob/main/backend/main.py"
      >Python</a
    > or <a
      target="_blank"
      href="https://github.com/gleasonw/bppb/blob/main/api/api.go">Go</a
    >, my user interfaces in React and Typescript. I've been using Postgres to
    persist my data, sometimes Redis for simple messaging. I have tried GraphQL
    for API data validation, but I think it's excessive for my needs. Instead,
    I'm using a lightweight combination of Zod and Pydantic to type the edges.
    I tested tRPC, but discovered I didn't need any state on my Next.js server for my Gallica app; I now fetch client-side instead. Tailwind is my css framework of choice. For static projects,
    such as this website, Astro.js has become my favorite tool.
