    I'm a French history major turned full-stack developer. I maintain a digital
    humanities tool, the <a

      href="https://d32d5ops9ui5td.cloudfront.net/">Gallica Grapher</a
    >. I'm currently migrating the project from CRA to Next.js and Typescript.

    I like to write my APIs in <a

      href="https://github.com/gleasonw/gallica-grapher/blob/main/backend/main.py"
      >Python</a
    > or <a
      target="_blank"
      href="https://github.com/gleasonw/goNWSproxy/blob/main/api.go">Go</a
    >, my user interfaces in React and Typescript. I've been using Postgres to
    persist my data. I have tried GraphQL for API data validation, but I think
    it's excessive for my needs. Instead, I'm experimenting with tRPC and
    Python's marvelous FastAPI. Tailwind is my css framework of choice. For
    static projects, such as this website, Astro.js is my favorite tool.

    One developer, whom I appreciate, lists only an apple cider recipe on their website.
    Because I need a job, I will not do that. One day, perhaps. For now, I code.

    The story so far...

          The project relied heavily on the French National Library's digital
          press archive, Gallica.
        </li>
        <li>
          I cobbled together some visualizations of word usage in French
          periodicals with Python and R's ggplot library.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Gallica API was so vast and interesting, though, that I wanted to
          make it more accessible. Dreams of a user-friendly web app came to
          mind...

          I taught English to middle schoolers and high schoolers. In my spare
          time, I developed the Python backend of the Gallica Grapher.
        </li>
        <li>
          Adventures in multithreading ensued. The Gallica API limited requests
          to 50 records, so large requests took a long time.
        </li>
        <li>
          To make the waiting more bearable, I implemented a progress tracking
          thread that pinged progress updates from a Celery worker in charge of
          the fetching.
        </li>
        <li>
          The stub of a website was taking shape. I was working with JQuery,
          though, and state management was difficult. Progress on the UI was
          slow -- I did manage to get a search bar working for the 14,000
          periodicals Gallica has archived.

        <li>
          The Python library that allowed me to run R code, rpy2, was slow to
          start up. I believe the Python-R link was designed for an academic
          audience, not a production one. Not wanting to abandon Python, I
          decided to migrate away from R for my data transformations.
        </li>
        <li>
          I experimented with Numpy and Pandas, but they felt like unfamiliar
          versions of SQL. Since my transformations weren't complicated, I
          decided to transform everything in Postgres. Average window and
          smoothing were straightforward to implement.
        </li>
        <li>
          Without ggplot, I needed a graphing library. I tried Plotly for a
          while, but it felt unwieldy. Using inspect element, I noticed that
          Lichess.com, a chess website I occasionally frequent, uses
          Highcharts.js to render their elo graphs. It worked very well!

          Back from France, I decided to continue developing the web app. I
          hoped to make exploring the Gallica archive as easy as possible. The
          digital humanities field has not yet caught up the UX standards of the
          rest of the web.
        </li>
        <li>
          JQuery being a consistent pain, I began reading the React docs, and
          spun up a static app with CRA. Then I began adding state hooks. It was
          a thrilling moment when I realized I could change state and the UI
          would update for me. I began to experiment more freely, knowing that I
          wouldn't have to spend an hour wrangling DOM selectors with every
          significant change.
