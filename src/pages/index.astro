        I'm Will, a French history major turned full-stack developer. I maintain
        a digital humanities tool, <a
            target="_blank"
            href="https://d32d5ops9ui5td.cloudfront.net/">the Gallica Grapher</a
        >. I'm currently migrating the project from CRA to Next.js and
        Typescript.
        <br />
        <br />
        I like to write my APIs in Python or Go, my user interfaces in React and
        Typescript. I use Postgres to persist my data. I have tried GraphQL for API
        data validation, but I think it's excessive for my needs. Instead, I have
        started experimenting with tRPC and Python's marvelous FastAPI. Tailwind
        is my css framework of choice. For static projects, such as this website,
        Astro.js is my favorite tool.
        <br />
        <br />
        One developer, whom I appreciate, lists only an apple cider recipe on their
        website. Because I need a job, I will not do that. One day, perhaps.
