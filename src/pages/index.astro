    I'm a 2021 Carleton College graduate and French history major. I believe the
    humanities need better software. In this spirit, I maintain the <a
      target="_blank"
      href="https://www.gallicagrapher.com/">Gallica Grapher</a
    >, a tool that plots word occurrences in 19th-century French newspapers. I'm
    currently migrating the app from CRA to Next.js and Typescript.

    I like to write my APIs in <a
      target="_blank"
      href="https://github.com/gleasonw/gallica-grapher/blob/main/backend/main.py"
      >Python</a
    > or <a
      target="_blank"
      href="https://github.com/gleasonw/bppb/blob/main/api/api.go">Go</a
    >, my user interfaces in React and Typescript. I've been using Postgres to
    persist my data, sometimes Redis for simple messaging. I have tried GraphQL
    for API data validation, but I think it's excessive for my needs. Instead,
    I'm experimenting with tRPC and Python's marvelous FastAPI. Tailwind is my
    css framework of choice. For static projects, such as this website, Astro.js
    has become my favorite tool.

    One developer, whom I appreciate, lists only an apple cider recipe on their website.
    Because I need a job, I will not do that. One day, perhaps. For now, I code.
