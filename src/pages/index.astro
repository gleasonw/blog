      I'm a developer, 2021 Carleton College graduate, and French history major. I currently work in Lyon, France as a web developer. On the side, I maintain the 
      <TabLink url="https://www.gallicagrapher.com/">Gallica Grapher</TabLink>, a tool that plots word occurrences in 19th-century French newspapers.
      I also maintain a <TabLink url="https://nl-joke-val.vercel.app/">Twitch chat dashboard</TabLink> for Northernlion's chat. A Go server
      counts emotes, +2s, and -2s, creating a live feed of the stream. I recently started <TabLink url="https://lidnd.com/">LiDnD</TabLink>, an encounter management tool for DnD.

      I like to write my APIs in <TabLink url="https://github.com/gleasonw/gallica-getter/blob/main/main.py">Python</TabLink>
      or <TabLink url="https://github.com/gleasonw/nl_joke_val/blob/main/emote_tracking/emote_counter.go">Go</TabLink>, my user interfaces in Typescript, using React or Vue.
