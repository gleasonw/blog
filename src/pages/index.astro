    I'm a 2021 Carleton College graduate and French history major. I believe the
    humanities need better software. In this spirit, I maintain the <a
      target="_blank"
      href="https://www.gallicagrapher.com/">Gallica Grapher</a
    >, a tool that plots word occurrences in 19th-century French newspapers. I
    developed the front end portion of the application while job searching in 2022; I
    documented the process in this <a href="/development_blog"
      >engineering blog</a
    >.

    I like to write my APIs in <a
      target="_blank"
      href="https://github.com/gleasonw/gallica-grapher/blob/main/backend/main.py"
      >Python</a
    > or <a
      target="_blank"
      href="https://github.com/gleasonw/bppb/blob/main/api/api.go">Go</a
    >, my user interfaces in React and Typescript. I've been using Postgres to
    persist my data, sometimes Redis for simple messaging. I have tried GraphQL
    for API data validation, but I think it's excessive for my needs. Instead,
    I'm using a lightweight combination of Zod and Pydantic to type the edges. I
    tested tRPC, but discovered I didn't need any state on my Next.js server for
    my Gallica app; I now fetch client-side instead. Tailwind is my css
    framework of choice. For static projects, such as this website, Astro.js has
    become my favorite tool.
