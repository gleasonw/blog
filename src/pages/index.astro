      I'm a developer, 2021 Carleton College graduate, and French history major. I currently work in Lyon, France as a web developer. You will find on this blog a collection of my thoughts, as is right. On the side, I maintain:
      <ol>
        <li>
          the <TabLink url="https://www.gallicagrapher.com/">Gallica Grapher</TabLink>, a tool that plots word occurrences in 19th-century French newspapers.
        </li>
        <li>
          a <TabLink url="https://nl-joke-val.vercel.app/">Twitch chat dashboard</TabLink> for Northernlion's chat. A Go server
          counts emotes, +2s, and -2s, creating a live feed of the stream. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <TabLink url="https://lidnd.com/">LiDnD</TabLink>, an encounter management tool for DnD. 
        </li>
        
      </ol> 
    </p>
    <p>
      I like to write my APIs in <TabLink url="https://github.com/gleasonw/gallica-getter/blob/main/main.py">Python</TabLink>
      or <TabLink url="https://github.com/gleasonw/nl_joke_val/blob/main/emote_tracking/emote_counter.go">Go</TabLink>, my user interfaces in Typescript, using React or Vue.
