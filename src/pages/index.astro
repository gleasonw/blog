<BaseLayout pageTitle="Hello there!">
    <TextBody>
        I'm Will Gleason, a full-stack developer in charge of two sites: the Gallica
        Grapher, a digital humanities tool, and the Battle Point Pickleball
        Monitor, a weather and court monitoring page for my local club.
        <br />
        <br />
        I currently write my APIs in Python or Go, my user interfaces in React and
        Typescript. I persist my data with Postgres. I have tried GraphQL for API
        data validation, but I think it's excessive for my current needs. I have
        started using either tRPC or Python's marvelous FastAPI. For static projects,
        such as this website, Astro.js is my favorite tool.
        <br />
        <br />
        A developer I appreciate lists only an apple cider recipe on their website.
        Because I need a job, I will not do that. Here's what I've been doing since
        graduating from Carleton College in 2021.
