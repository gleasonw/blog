        I'm a French history major turned full-stack developer. I maintain
        a digital humanities tool, <a
            target="_blank"
            href="https://d32d5ops9ui5td.cloudfront.net/">the Gallica Grapher</a
        >. I'm currently migrating the project from CRA to Next.js and
        Typescript.
        <br />
        <br />
        I like to write my APIs in Python or Go, my user interfaces in React and
        Typescript. I've been using Postgres to persist my data. I have tried GraphQL for API
        data validation, but I think it's excessive for my needs. Instead, I'm experimenting with tRPC and Python's marvelous FastAPI. Tailwind
        is my css framework of choice. For static projects, such as this website,
        Astro.js is my favorite tool.
        <br />
        <br />
        One developer, whom I appreciate, lists only an apple cider recipe on their
        website. Because I need a job, I will not do that. One day, perhaps. For now, I code.

        The story so far...
